Amlodipine is also used to prevent chest pain caused by heart disease (angina). This medicine is only available on prescription. It comes as tablets or as a liquid to swallow.', \"Amlodipine lowers your blood pressure and makes it easier for your heart to pump blood around your body. It's usual to take amlodipine once a day. You can take it at any time of day, but try to make sure it's around the same time each day. The most common side effects include headache, flushing, feeling tired and swollen ankles. These usually improve after a few days. Amlodipine can be called amlodipine besilate, amlodipine maleate or amlodipine mesilate. This is because the medicine contains another chemical to make it easier for your body to take up and use it. It doesn't matter what your amlodipine is called. They all work as well as each other. Amlodipine is also called by the brand names Istin and Amlostin.\", \"Amlodipine can be taken by adults and children aged 6 years and over. Amlodipine is not suitable for some people. To make sure amlodipine is safe for you, tell your doctor if you: have had an allergic reaction to amlodipine or any other medicines in the past are trying to get pregnant, are already pregnant or you're breastfeeding have liver or kidney disease have heart failure or you have recently had a heart attack\", \"4. How and when to take it Take amlodipine exactly as your doctor has told you, and follow the directions on the label. If you're not sure, check with your doctor or pharmacist. It's usual to take amlodipine once a day. You can take amlodipine at any time of day, but try to make sure it's around the same time every day. How much to take Amlodipine comes as 5mg and 10mg tablets. Depending on why you're taking amlodipine, the usual starting dose is 5mg once a day. If the starting dose isn't working well enough (your blood pressure doesn't lower enough, or your angina isn't controlled), you may need to increase your dose to 10mg. To decide the correct dose for you in the longer term, your doctor will check your blood pressure to make sure it's not too high or too low. They'll also ask if you're getting any side effects from the medicine. Doses may be lower for children. How to take it You can take amlodipine with or without food. Swallow amlodipine tablets whole with a drink of water. If it's easier, you can dissolve the tablets in a glass of water, but you must drink it all straight away if you do this. Do not eat or drink lots of grapefruit or grapefruit juice while you're taking this medicine. Grapefruit can increase the concentration of amlodipine in your body and worsen side effects. If you're taking amlodipine as a liquid, it'll come with a plastic syringe or spoon to help you measure out the right dose. If you don't have one, ask your pharmacist for one. Do not use a kitchen teaspoon as it will not give the right amount of medicine. Do not mix the liquid with food or other drinks before taking it. Important Take amlodipine even if you feel well, as you'll still be getting the benefits of the medicine. What if I forget to take it? If you forget to take a dose of amlodipine, take it as soon as you remember that day and then carry on as normal. If you forget to take the dose for the whole day, skip the missed dose and carry on as normal the next day. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten one. If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine. What if I take too much? If you take too much amlodipine by accident, contact your doctor or go to your nearest hospital straight away. An overdose of amlodipine can cause dizziness and sleepiness. The amount of amlodipine that can lead to an overdose varies from person to person. Urgent advice: Call your doctor or go to A&E straight away if you take too much amlodipine If you need to go to an A&E, do not drive yourself - get someone else to drive you or call for an ambulance. Take the amlodipine packet or leaflet inside it, plus any remaining medicine, with you.\")\n",

If you buy naproxen from a pharmacy for painful menstrual periods: on the first day - take 2 tablets when the pain starts, then after 6 to 8 hours take 1 more tablet that day if you need to on the second and following days - take 1 tablet every 6 to 8 hours if needed Important Do not take more than 3 tablets in 24 hours for period pain. How to take it Naproxen on prescription comes as 2 different tablets: effervescent and gastro-resistant tablets. Effervescent tablets are dissolved in water before you take them. Gastro-resistant tablets have a coating to protect them from being broken down by the acid in your stomach. Instead, the medicine is released further down the gut in your intestine. If you take gastro-resistant tablets, swallow them whole with or after food. Do not crush or chew them. If you take effervescent tablets, dissolve 1 to 2 tablets in a glass (150ml) of water and drink. Doses of 3 tablets should be dissolved in 300ml. To make sure there's no medicine left, rinse the empty glass with a small amount of water and drink it. Take with or after food. What if I forget to take it? Take your forgotten dose as soon as you remember, unless it's nearly time for your next dose. Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. If you forget doses often, it may help to set an alarm to remind you. You could also ask your pharmacist for advice on other ways to help you remember to take your medicine. What if I take too much? If you take too many naproxen tablets, you're more likely to get some of the common side effects. Contact your doctor straight away.\")\n",
